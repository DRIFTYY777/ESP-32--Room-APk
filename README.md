# Flutter Weather System with Firebase Authentication and ESP32 Integration

This project is a Flutter application for Android that allows users to:

Sign up and sign in: Create a secure account within the app using Firebase Authentication.
View weather data: Access real-time temperature, humidity, and wind speed data uploaded from a DIY weather station built with an ESP32 device using a Firebase Realtime Database.
Visualize data: The app presents the weather data in a user-friendly and visually appealing format.
Optional image gallery (Photo1.jpg to Photo4.jpg): You can optionally include a gallery of images (Photo1.jpg to Photo4.jpg) to provide additional context or visual aids.
## Key Features

Secure user authentication with Firebase Authentication
Real-time weather data display from a DIY ESP32 weather station via Firebase Realtime Database
User-friendly data visualization with customization options (consider adding this)
Optional image gallery (Photo1.jpg to Photo4.jpg)
## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites

Android device with Android Studio or a Flutter development environment (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
A Firebase project with enabled Authentication and Realtime Database services (https://firebase.google.com/)
An ESP32 device set up as a DIY weather station following the instructions in the ESP32 project by DRIFTYY777 (https://github.com/paulgreg/esp32-weather-station):
This project should collect weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and upload it to your Firebase Realtime Database.
2. Project Setup

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run flutter pub get to install the required dependencies.
3. Firebase Configuration

Create a Firebase project (if you haven't already).
Enable the Authentication and Realtime Database services in your Firebase project.
Follow the Firebase documentation (https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) to create a Flutter app and download the google-services.json file.
Place the google-services.json file in the android/app directory of your project.
4. ESP32 Integration

Important: Ensure the ESP32 project is configured to upload data to the correct path in your Firebase Realtime Database. This path should be accessible by your Flutter app. Refer to the ESP32 project's README for details.
5. Flutter App Code

The Flutter app code should retrieve weather data from your Firebase Realtime Database at the path where the ESP32 project is uploading data.
Consider using Firebase StreamBuilder or similar mechanisms to listen for real-time updates from the database and update the app's UI accordingly.
6. Building and Running the App

Connect your Android device to your computer or use an emulator.
Run flutter run to build and deploy the app to your device.
## Additional Notes

Consider implementing error handling and user feedback mechanisms within the app.
Explore advanced features in Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database for enhanced functionality.
The optional image gallery section can be customized to display different images or integrate with an external image storage service.
## Disclaimer

This README assumes a basic understanding of Flutter development. For detailed Flutter setup instructions, refer to the official documentation (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

Remember to consult the ESP32 project by DRIFTYY777 (https://github.com/paulgreg/esp32-weather-station) for specific instructions on setting up your DIY weather station and ensuring it uploads data to Firebase.

I hope this comprehensive README file empowers you to successfully set up and utilize your Flutter weather system application with the ESP32 integration!
